# Minecraft-Automated-Forge-Server
This project is a game directory for a Minecraft-Forge profile that contains Python scripts for automatically starting the server and making the modpack available for download directly from your computer (embeded web-server). Just point your Minecraft Launcher profile to this folder for single player. Then use start-server.py to start a multiplayer server. While the server is running, your friends can just enter your computer's URL (IP address) on port 8080 in their web browser to download a copy of the modpack (e.g. http://192.168.0.4:8080 ). Stop the server by executing close-server.py
